![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e272181-fddc-4203-b641-4445eb445e42)

## Features
• Automatic egg/plant watering.  
  *(Can only be turned on if you're the host)*

• Automatic deletion of player kobolds who have left the lobby. (Has to be actively running to keep check of player kobolds, turning it on/off will just restart it.)  
  *(Can only be turned on if you're the host)*

• Anti-grab - Nobody can grab you when it's activated, but you also can't grab anyone else. (Ideal if you're afk, also has the side effect of preventing you from being spawn-stack grabbed)  
  *(Can be turned on in any lobby)*

• Fat stat locker - Prevents you from losing- or gaining weight.

• Ragdoll-toggler - Toggle ragdolling on/off. -> Not functional due to game bug.

• Removes the pop-up windows when entering the main menu.  
  *(This is always on.)*

• Chat Window Size Changer - Make your chat window bigger by picking one of the options in the menu. Your selection will be saved in the config file.

• Dick As Inflator - Your dick will be able to inflate anyone's stomach, meaning their stomach capacity will grow as you cum in them when their stomach is full.

• Dick Cum Replacer - Replace your cum with other fluids types! Yep, that's it!  
  *(Can be turned on in a lobby where the host also has this plugin and cheats enabled.)*

• Cursor Unlocker - Instead of using TAB to show the cursor, you can now just press F3.

• Fat Stat Locker - Will simply lock your character's fat to whatever value you currently have when you turn it on. It will not change no matter what until you turn it off again.

• Gone are the days when you'd be stuck in an infinite void when joining a server that has a missing mod or mod conflict with your game... Now there's error-handling, meaning if a mod issue is raised when joining a server, you'll be booted back to the main menu with an error message containing the type of error and what mod is causing the issue.  
  *(This is always on.)*

• Head equipment hiding feature when playing in first person camera.

All of these features are toggleable mid-game, with the exception of not being able to toggle anti-grab when actively being grabbed.
The menu window can be dragged around the screen to be somewhere else. The window position will be saved upon closing the game, so it'll be in the same place next time.
